# cone-classification
The use of adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to probe color perception at the individual cone level is of increasing interest in the vision science community. Such experiments are enabled by an accurate map of a subject's cone mosaic. There is need for a fast, accurate, and accessible cone classification method. For our project, we propose a densitometry method for estimating cone types using an AOSLO and an algorithm for optical feedback which exploits differences in cone absorption spectra. We hope that this project will improve on or complement the state-of-the-art densitometry cone classification methods.
