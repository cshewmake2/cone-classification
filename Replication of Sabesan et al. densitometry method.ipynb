    "## Goal: Replicate the results of Sabesan et al. method for classifying cones\n",
    "\n",
    "* They used $543$ and $842nm$ light. \n",
    "* $842nm$ used for wavefront correction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "* Subjects dark adapted for 5 minutes to get to >90% maximum density\n",
    "* Two different protocols for classifying S- and L/M-type cones. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Start with S-type classification\n",
    "* Separated by simultaneous photopigment bleaching and AO-corrected imaging at 543 nm wave- length, immediately following dark adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### L/M-type classification\n",
    "* To distinguish between L & M cones, a sep- arate partial and selective bleaching step was added between dark adaptation and imaging. This was performed to prepare the L and M cones in a state which elicits the maximum difference in their absorptance prior to bleaching and imaging with 543 nm wavelength. \n",
    "* Two such selective bleaches were used: a 680 nm wavelength was used to selectively bleach the L cones more (~15x) than M cones\n",
    "* 470 nm wavelength was used to selectively bleach the M cones more (~1.8x) than L cones. \n",
    "* With either wavelength, however, L and M photopigments are bleached simultaneously, albeit differentially, necessitating a careful selection of optimum bleaching doses"
